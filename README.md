# ciftlik_vergi_simulat-or

This project provides a simple React component for a farm tax simulator.

## Development

1. Install dependencies (none are required but this step will create `node_modules`):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the build step and open `dist/index.html` in a browser. React and Babel are loaded from a CDN so no bundler is required.

## Production build

Run the build command to generate the distributable files:
```bash
npm run build
```
